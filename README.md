# MRI-Prep-Simulator-with-CGH-
With time, technology improves and advancement in medical equipment such as LASIK for example, commonly referred to as laser eye surgery which is able restore blurred vision. MRI machines are no exception. It helps doctors to diagnose the insides of the human body without the need to do surgery. However, despite having such equipment, there are still limitations to them, such as dry eyes and regression for patients undergoing LASIK [1], MRI users also face different problems like claustrophobia and anxiety due to the confined space and loud noises where approximately 15% of all patients who are taking the MRI scan suffer from claustrophobia and cannot be imaged due to unnecessary movements [2]. These problems may vary according to people, especially uncomforting for those who are first timers. Here at Temasek Polytechnic, we a group of engineering students are tasked to help reduce the variation of behaviours which would affect the MRI scan results between different patients by developing an MRI scan simulator to help the patients get used to the procedures before going in for the real scan. Our project uses the wireless sensors available on the market and our coding knowledge to create a network of sensors to monitor the vital sign status of patients whilst going through the simulation. This enables the hospital staff to diagnose what is causing the patient to have unnecessary movements prior to the actual scan.
